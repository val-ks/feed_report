## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to automate the generation and delivery of an analytical summary for an application's key metrics. By automating the reporting process, the project aims to save time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually compiling and sending the reports.

## Analytical Summary

The generated analytical summary will include the following essential metrics:

- **DAU (Daily Active Users)**: This metric indicates the number of unique users who interacted with the application on a daily basis.
- **Views**: This metric represents the total number of times the application's content or features were accessed or viewed.
- **Likes**: This metric denotes the total number of likes received on the application's content or features.
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: This metric measures the ratio of users who clicked on a specific element or feature to the total number of users who viewed it.

These metrics provide valuable insights into the application's performance and user engagement. Regularly receiving these reports every morning through the Telegram channel ensures that stakeholders have access to up-to-date information about the application's performance and can make informed decisions based on the provided metrics.

By implementing this project, stakeholders can effectively monitor the application's key metrics and optimize their strategies and decision-making processes accordingly.
